# Changelog

All notable changes to Mnemo are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Initial Release

Mnemo is an MCP-native memory database that gives AI agents persistent, searchable, and secure long-term memory.

### Highlights

- **10 MCP tools** for AI agents: remember, recall, forget, share, checkpoint, branch, merge, replay, delegate, and verify
- **Hybrid search** combining semantic vectors, BM25 keyword matching, knowledge graph signals, and recency scoring via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Two storage backends**: embedded DuckDB for single-agent use and PostgreSQL with pgvector for distributed multi-agent deployments
- **SDKs** for Python (with OpenAI Agents, Mem0, LangGraph, and CrewAI adapters), TypeScript, and Go
- **Multiple access protocols**: MCP (stdio), REST API, gRPC, and PostgreSQL wire protocol

### Features

- **Memory lifecycle management** -- five forgetting strategies (soft delete, hard delete, decay, consolidation, archive), TTL-based expiration, and automatic decay passes
- **Security and integrity** -- AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption, SHA-256 hash chain integrity verification, RBAC with ACL-based permission filtering, memory poisoning detection, and delegation with depth-limited transitive permissions
- **Conflict resolution** -- automatic detection of contradictory memories with newest-wins, highest-importance, manual, and evidence-weighted resolution strategies
- **Branching and replay** -- checkpoint agent state, branch timelines, merge branches, and replay event history with hash chain verification
- **Causal debugging** -- trace event causality chains with configurable direction (up/down/both) and event-type filtering
- **Point-in-time queries** -- recall memories as they existed at any historical timestamp using `as_of`
- **Observability** -- OTLP span ingestion with OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, admin dashboard with agent statistics

### Infrastructure

- 9-crate Rust workspace with full CI (format, clippy, test, build, security audit)
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment with S3 cold-storage support
- Docker and Docker Compose configurations
- mdBook documentation site

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-07

### Security

- **Fix SQL injection in PostgreSQL backend** -- replaced string-interpolated embedding values with parameterized `pgvector::Vector` bindings via sqlx
- **Add authentication to pgwire server** -- cleartext password authentication before connection acceptance; default bind changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`
- **Harden CORS configuration** -- replaced permissive CORS with configurable origin allowlist via `MNEMO_CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable, defaulting to localhost only
- **Fix delegation authorization bypass** -- delegation endpoint now verifies the caller has `Delegate` permission on each target memory before creating delegations
- **Upgrade pyo3 to 0.24** -- fixes buffer overflow in `PyString::from_object` (RUSTSEC-2025-0020)
- **Upgrade tantivy to 0.25** -- resolves transitive `lru` crate unsoundness
- **Add constant-time hash comparison** -- all hash verification now uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` to prevent timing side-channel attacks
- **Sanitize error responses** -- internal error details are logged server-side; clients receive generic error messages
- **Add request body size limits** -- REST API enforces a 2 MB maximum request body to prevent denial-of-service via oversized payloads
- **Add prompt injection detection** -- memory content is now scanned for 11 common prompt injection patterns during anomaly scoring

### Improvements

- **Add CI security scanning** -- new cargo-audit job in GitHub Actions plus Dependabot for Cargo, npm, and GitHub Actions dependencies
- **Add agent_id input validation** -- agent identifiers are now validated for length (max 256 characters) and allowed characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, dots)
- **Add sync_metadata table to PostgreSQL migrations** -- ensures sync watermark operations work correctly in distributed deployments
- **Generate TypeScript SDK lockfile** -- `package-lock.json` committed for reproducible builds and `npm audit` support

### Documentation

- Remove hardcoded passwords from deployment examples -- Docker, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL docs now use environment variable references
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- Add project memory configuration for development tooling
